<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, API's</p>
<br>
<p>
I built out this site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the cocktailDB API.

- HTML5 provided the structure and content for the website
- CSS3 was used to style and layout the website
- JavaScript was used to fetch and parse the data from the cocktailDB API
</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
- How API's handle data and how to use that data to push information to the DOM / user.
